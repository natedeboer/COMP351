# COMP351 Individual Project

I recieve lots of 502 Bad Gateway errors and I cannot figure out how to fix them. They dissappear once you refresh the page. 
The API calls to the server also often take a long time (5-10 seconds). Sometimes the calls are very fast. Perhaps this is because of the glowhost server infastructure.
